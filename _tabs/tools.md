## 🛠️ My Security Toolkit

Welcome to my tools page. Here is a curated list of tools I use for **Binary Exploitation (Pwn)** and **Reverse Engineering**.

### 1. Exploitation Frameworks
* **[Pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools):** My primary framework for crafting exploits.
* **[GEF (GDB Enhanced Features)](https://github.com/hugsy/gef):** Essential for dynamic analysis during debugging.

### 2. Reverse Engineering
* **Ghidra:** For deep static analysis and decompilation.
* **IDA Free:** Excellent for quick binary navigation.

### 3. Custom Scripts
> *Note: I will be uploading my custom Python automation scripts here soon. Stay tuned!*
